# MLInstance-TreeClassifiers
This repository houses implementations of K-Nearest Neighbours &amp; Decision Tree Classifiers from scratch - done as a group project by:
- Jack Parry-Wingfield https://github.com/JackPW-lang
- Alina Shimizu https://github.com/alinashimizu
- Lucas Andrade https://github.com/lucasandrdd

As one of many group projects in the COMP551 Machine Learning course at McGill. Collaborators are solely those listed above. You can find the detailed LaTeX documentation here:

# File Layout
This repository contains the following python files:
- The KNN class
- The DT class
- The remaining python code where we preprocess two datasets (one for binary classification and one for multiple classes) and run experiments to observe our models' performance. The results, along with details on the datasets and the preprocessing are detailed in the above pdf document.
